# viral-Genomics-WGS-WES
WGS sequences the entire viral genome to identify mutations, track variants, and understand viral evolution. It provides a complete view of the virus for surveillance, outbreak investigation, and vaccine/drug development. WES focuses on protein-coding regions to detect changes that may affect viral infectivity, immune escape, or drug resistance.
